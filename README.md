AppSec CoHack: Breaking and Defending with OWASP Classics

## 🎯 Workshop Overview

Welcome to the AppSec CoHack 2025 - a hands-on, learn-by-doing workshop focused on understanding and defending against the most critical web application security vulnerabilities. This workshop will take you through the journey of both exploiting and securing applications against well-known attacks that consistently rank in the OWASP Top 10.

## 🔍 What You'll Learn

This workshop focuses on two critical vulnerability classes that have plagued web applications for decades:

### 1. SQL Injection (SQLi)
- Understanding different types of SQL injection attacks
- Exploiting vulnerable database queries
- Impact assessment and data exfiltration techniques
- Defense mechanisms and secure coding practices

### 2. Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
- Understanding CSRF attack vectors
- Exploiting lack of proper request validation
- Session hijacking and unauthorized actions
- Implementing anti-CSRF tokens and defenses

## 🎮 Hands-On Learning Environment

You'll gain practical experience using industry-standard vulnerable applications:

### OWASP Juice Shop
- Modern web application with intentional security flaws
- Real-world scenarios in a safe environment
- Progressive difficulty levels

### OWASP WebGoat
- Interactive lessons with guided tutorials
- Step-by-step vulnerability exploitation
- Built-in hints and explanations

## 🛠️ What You'll Do

1. **Deploy** vulnerable applications in controlled environments
2. **Showcase** real-world attack scenarios
3. **Exploit** vulnerabilities using common tools and techniques
4. **Implement** security controls and mitigation strategies
5. **Apply** secure development best practices

## 🛡️ Security Best Practices

Throughout the workshop, you'll learn:
